<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p> 
Everything we do will always come back to affect us and that definitely includes the negative things. As humans we pollute our planet more than we think and most importantly we pollute our oceans. These actions have major consequences on us, the organisms around us, and most importantly the entire world. As we evolve it would seem that our responsibility and care for our planet would become more important and that we would take care of the world around us. However, as our technology improves and knowledge of the work around us increases day by day, we still refuse to depose of our trash responsibly. For example, around fourteen billion pounds of trash is dumped into the ocean each year, which can have unimaginable consequences on marine life and other humans around the world. In addition, freshwater is used by many factories who contaminate the water and releasee it back into the the ocean. We can solve this long lasting problem of water pollution together because change starts with you.
